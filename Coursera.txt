My father resigned his job due to the pressure faced in the company he worked for more than 10 years. He was our family's main source of income. My mother remains employed, but she works in our family owned land to help my father with the source of income. Consequently, we are now unable to provide the additional funds I'll need for outstanding tuition, books, and expenses. My parents also give me what they can each month and myself doing what I can do do to support my family. My mother worked many hours as a housekeeper in a hotel. They saved what they could, but we do not have enough savings to pay for my college education. Receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies during the week without having to worry about earning extra money. I would continue to work on the weekends to cover my living expenses, but I would be able to keep the weekdays free to focus solely on my school work.
